# A2A extension: VAID as a per-hop delegation proof

**Status: draft.**
Implements the VAID attenuation and revocation primitives (ADR-0003, ADR-0007,
`docs/spec/revocation.md`) as an [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org) extension. Not
part of the VAID conformance surface (no frozen vector polices this document);
normative where stated, otherwise explanatory.

Terminology follows the repo: a **VAID** is the signed document (`Vaid`);
**attenuation** is the parent-to-child containment of scope, capabilities, tenant
and expiry; **chain verification** is end-to-end authority checking over a
presented ancestry (`vaid_mint.chain`).

---

## 0. Extension URI

```
https://github.com/solara-associates/vaid/blob/main/docs/a2a/v1/extension.md
```

This is the permanent extension URI, decided by Allan in the session 306
follow-up. It resolves to this versioned document, satisfying the A2A
requirement that an extension URI be a resolvable, stable identifier.

## 1. Relationship to #2028

[a2aproject/A2A#2028](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/issues/2028) proposes
`actorChain`: a caller-supplied, append-only record of who acted for whom, with
monotonic scope narrowing checked hop by hop. The thread is explicit, and correctly
so, that narrowing is a **well-formedness** check on the payload alone and proves
nothing about **authority** — a fabricated chain narrows perfectly. The thread's
own proposed fix is a per-hop `proof_ref`: an externally resolvable reference that
lets a verifier confirm a hop's authority without trusting the caller's payload.

This extension does not compete with `actorChain`. It supplies one concrete,
checkable shape for that reference: a VAID is a self-contained, offline-verifiable
proof of attenuated authority, Ed25519-signed, with its own revocation and
expiry semantics already specified (`docs/spec/revocation.md`, ADR-0007). Where
`actorChain` carries `actors[n].scopes` as a claim, this extension lets a hop
additionally carry a VAID as the resolvable evidence for that claim — the
`proof_ref` / `credentialRef` slot the #2028 thread converges on, filled with a
format this repo already mints and verifies in three languages.

Carrying a VAID under this extension's metadata key does not require `actorChain`
to be present. The two compose: a deployment running both puts the VAID's
`vaid_id` in the hop's `proof_ref` (or `credentialRef`, per the ZeroID mapping in
the thread) and the VAID document itself under this extension's metadata key, so
a verifier that understands both extensions can resolve the reference and check
the attached proof, while a verifier that understands only `actorChain` sees an
opaque reference it cannot resolve — which the #2028 thread already establishes
must never be read as a denial.

## 2. AgentCard declaration

Declared as an `AgentExtension` entry in `capabilities.extensions[]`:

```json
{
  "uri": "https://github.com/solara-associates/vaid/blob/main/docs/a2a/v1/extension.md",
  "description": "VAID per-hop delegation proof: attenuated, Ed25519-signed, revocable.",
  "required": false,
  "params": {
    "acceptedVersions": ["v3"],
    "issuerKeyDiscovery": "static",
    "trustedIssuers": [
      {
        "trustDomain": "vaid.example",
        "kernelPublicKey": "<base64url, raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key>"
      }
    ],
    "requireVaid": false
  }
}
```

`params` fields:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `acceptedVersions` | VAID signature-scheme versions this agent verifies. Currently always `["v3"]` (`VAID_SIG_VERSION_V3`); listed as an array so a future `v4` can be added without a new extension URI. |
| `issuerKeyDiscovery` | How this agent resolves a kernel public key for an incoming document's `kernel_key_thumbprint`. `"static"` means the keys are listed inline in `trustedIssuers`. Other discovery methods (a JWKS-style endpoint, a registry) are out of scope for this draft and MUST NOT be assumed from the field's absence. |
| `trustedIssuers` | Present when `issuerKeyDiscovery` is `"static"`. Each entry is a trust domain and the **raw kernel public key** this agent accepts for it — never a bare thumbprint. A thumbprint alone cannot verify a signature; it is a selector, not key material, and listing only a thumbprint here would verify nothing. The verifier derives each entry's thumbprint from `kernelPublicKey` itself (`kernel_key_thumbprint`, ADR-0004) and uses that to select which key to check an incoming document's signature against — mirroring `vaid_mint.chain.KernelKeyMap`, which is built the same way, from keys, never from a caller-supplied thumbprint. A document whose claimed thumbprint matches no derived entry here is not trusted, full stop; this is the extension-level expression of the `docs/trust-anchor.md` rule that resolving a key from a source the presenter controls verifies nothing. |
| `requireVaid` | If `true`, this agent refuses any request activating this extension that carries no resolvable VAID on the leaf hop. If `false` (default), a request with no VAID is handled as if the extension were not activated for that hop — the extension degrades to absent, never to a weaker check. |

An agent declaring `required: true` is stating that peers MUST understand and
honour this extension to interoperate with it at all — ordinary A2A extension
semantics, not special to VAID.

## 3. Activation

Standard A2A per-request activation: a client that wants a VAID-bearing request
checked under this extension sends the extension's URI in the `A2A-Extensions`
request header (comma-separated if other extensions are also activated). An agent
that supports the extension and chooses to honour it on this request echoes the
URI back in its own `A2A-Extensions` response header. An agent that does not
support it, or declines to activate it for this request, omits the URI from its
response header — the client then knows the extension was not applied and must not
assume VAID verification occurred.

## 4. Where the VAID travels

The VAID document (the full JSON object, not a wrapped or re-encoded form) is
carried in `Message.metadata`, keyed by this extension's URI with a `/vaid`
suffix, following the `metadata["{extension-uri}/{field-name}"]` pattern A2A
extensions use generally:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "https://github.com/solara-associates/vaid/blob/main/docs/a2a/v1/extension.md/vaid": {
      "vaid_id": "...",
      "agent_id": "...",
      "agent_class": "...",
      "version": "...",
      "tenant_id": "...",
      "issued_at": "...",
      "expires_at": "...",
      "public_key_der": [ ... ],
      "kernel_signature": [ ... ],
      "scope_boundary": [ ... ],
      "lineage_hash": "...",
      "capability_set": [ ... ],
      "trust_domain": "...",
      "kernel_key_thumbprint": "...",
      "sig_version": 3,
      "parent_vaid": null
    }
  }
}
```

This is the leaf — the VAID of the agent that produced the `Message`. Ancestor
documents the verifier needs to walk the chain (§5) travel the same way, under a
sibling key with a `/vaidChain` suffix, as a JSON array of VAID documents in no
particular order (the verifier assembles ancestry from `parent_vaid`, not from
array position):

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "https://github.com/solara-associates/vaid/blob/main/docs/a2a/v1/extension.md/vaidChain": [
      { "vaid_id": "...parent...", "parent_vaid": "...grandparent-or-null...", "...": "..." },
      { "vaid_id": "...grandparent...", "parent_vaid": null, "...": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

An agent that activates the extension but finds no `/vaid` key present treats the
hop as not carrying a VAID (§2's `requireVaid` governs whether that is fatal). A
`/vaidChain` key present with no `/vaid` key is malformed input under §6's
authenticity check.

### 4.1 Mapping onto a #2028 `actorChain` hop

When both extensions are active, a hop in `actors[]` that carries a VAID as its
proof sets its reference field (`proof_ref` or `credentialRef`, per whichever name
the `actorChain` text settles on) to the VAID's `vaid_id`. The verifier resolves
that reference by looking up the matching `vaid_id` in this extension's `/vaid` or
`/vaidChain` metadata on the same message — resolution is local to the message,
not a network fetch, which is exactly the "opaque reference, dereference
authorized separately" shape the #2028 thread asks for: the reference is inert
until the resolving party chooses to look at the attached proof.

## 5. Verification rules

A receiving agent that activates this extension on an incoming request applies
the following checks, **in this order**, against the VAID in the `/vaid` metadata
key and, where the request requires chain verification, the documents in
`/vaidChain`. The order is load-bearing, for the same reason it is load-bearing in
`vaid_mint.verify` and `vaid_mint.chain`: two verifiers that reach the same boolean
by different routes can still disagree about *why*, and that disagreement is
invisible unless the reason is named.

1. **Signature.** The leaf VAID's Ed25519 kernel signature verifies against a
   kernel public key this agent trusts for the claimed `trust_domain` /
   `kernel_key_thumbprint` (resolved per §2's `trustedIssuers`, never from a key
   the message itself supplies). Equivalent to
   `vaid_mint.verify.verify_vaid_authenticity_graded`. Any `UNPARSEABLE`,
   `UNSUPPORTED_SIG_VERSION`, `MALFORMED_TRUST_DOMAIN`, `ISSUER_MISMATCH`,
   `LINEAGE_INCONSISTENT` or `INAUTHENTIC` result fails the request; see §6 for
   the specific error returned.
2. **Expiry / TTL.** The leaf VAID has not passed its own `expires_at` at the
   verification instant (`vaid_mint.document.is_expired`).
3. **Chain integrity back to a trusted root.** If `/vaidChain` is present, or the
   agent's policy requires chain verification regardless, every ancestor named by
   a signed `parent_vaid` is present in `/vaidChain`, every document in the chain
   is itself authentic under a trusted key, and no ancestor has passed its own
   `expires_at` at the verification instant. Equivalent to
   `vaid_mint.chain.verify_chain_at` through the point where it would return
   `INAUTHENTIC`, `UNVERIFIABLE` or `EXPIRED`. An agent that does not require chain
   verification for this request MAY check only the leaf (steps 1-2 and
   step 6 against the leaf's own authority) and skip to step 7.
4. **Scope at each hop is a subset of its parent's.** Every hop in the assembled
   chain holds `scope_boundary` and `capability_set` contained in its parent's,
   and `expires_at` no later than its parent's. Equivalent to the per-hop
   `scope_attenuates`, `caps_attenuate` and `expiry_attenuates` checks inside
   `verify_chain_at`; a violation is `NOT_ATTENUATED`.

   **The empty-set rules.** An empty `scope_boundary` means unrestricted: it
   contains every resource (`vaid_mint.document.is_in_scope`,
   `vaid_mint.mint.scope_attenuates_within`). An empty `capability_set` means no
   capabilities: it contains none (`vaid_mint.document.has_capability`,
   `vaid_mint.mint.caps_attenuate_within`). Because an empty scope is
   unrestricted, a child may carry an empty `scope_boundary` only if its
   parent's `scope_boundary` is also empty; a child with no declared parent
   scope to inherit from cannot be granted the unrestricted one
   (`vaid_mint.mint.scope_attenuates_within`'s empty-child guard). There is no
   corresponding guard for `capability_set`, because an empty child
   capability set is already the most restrictive case and attenuates under
   any parent.
5. **Requested action is within the leaf's scope.** The specific action the
   message is requesting is checked against the leaf VAID's `scope_boundary`
   (`vaid_mint.document.is_in_scope`) and, if the action corresponds to a named
   capability, `capability_set` (`has_capability`). This is a property of the
   single leaf document, not of the chain, and is NOT subsumed by step 4: a
   well-attenuated chain can still present a leaf whose own scope does not cover
   the action actually being requested.
6. **Revocation of every link, via a pluggable check.** The agent consults its own
   `vaid_mint.revocation.RevocationCheck` (or equivalent in another language) over
   the full assembled lineage, root to leaf. A `REVOKED` result anywhere in the
   lineage fails the request (R.4.4: revoked anywhere in the lineage means revoked).
   An `UNAVAILABLE` result — the check could not be consulted — **fails closed**,
   exactly as `vaid_mint.revocation` specifies: it is never treated as
   `NOT_REVOKED`, and never silently skipped.
7. If every applicable step above passes, the request is **authorized** by this
   extension's check. This extension makes no statement about any other
   authorization layer the receiving agent runs; a VAID clearing this check is a
   necessary signal, not an all-encompassing one, exactly as `actorChain` narrowing
   is explicitly not a grant of authority in #2028.

**Fail closed throughout.** Every step above that can return "could not
determine" — an unresolvable issuer key, an incomplete chain, an unavailable
revocation check — is a distinct failure from "determined and rejected", and
both are refusals. Neither is ever treated as a pass. This mirrors
`vaid_mint.verify.VaidVerdict.INDETERMINATE` and
`vaid_mint.revocation.RevocationStatus.UNAVAILABLE`: "could not tell" is reported
as itself, not folded into either boundary.

## 6. Error behaviour

A2A defines JSON-RPC-shaped errors on the `Message/send` and related methods.
This extension does not introduce a new wire-level error class; it maps a
verification failure onto the existing A2A error space as follows:

- A malformed or absent VAID where `requireVaid` is `true` (§2), or a VAID that
  fails §5 step 1 (authenticity) or step 3 (chain integrity/`UNVERIFIABLE`): the
  agent returns an A2A **`InvalidRequestError`** (or the transport's equivalent
  "the request could not be validated" error), since the fault is in what the
  caller presented, not in a transient condition.
- A VAID that fails §5 step 2 (expired), step 4 (not attenuated) or step 5
  (action outside scope): the agent returns an A2A **authorization-class error**
  — the error A2A defines for "the caller is not permitted to do this", with a
  `message` naming which check failed (expiry, attenuation, or out-of-scope
  action) without echoing signed document bytes back on the wire unnecessarily.
- A revocation check that reports `REVOKED`: the same authorization-class error
  as above, naming revocation as the cause.
- A revocation check (or key resolution) that reports it could not determine an
  answer (`UNAVAILABLE`): the agent returns the same authorization-class error —
  fail-closed, per §5 — but SHOULD distinguish this in its own logs/audit from a
  positive `REVOKED` determination, for the reason `VaidVerdict.INDETERMINATE`'s
  docstring gives: one is an accusation, the other is a refusal to vouch.

Exact A2A error type names are left to the A2A core error taxonomy as published;
this section states the mapping principle (fault class -> which existing A2A
error family) rather than inventing new error codes, since inventing one here
would be exactly the kind of extension-introduced vocabulary §7 warns against for
metadata keys.

## 7. Naming

Every metadata key, `params` field and concept this extension introduces is named
`vaid*` (`/vaid`, `/vaidChain`, `acceptedVersions`, etc. under the VAID extension
URI's namespace). None of them is named `synthera*`, and none of them reuses or
aliases any `x-synthera-*` header defined elsewhere in this repository. This
extension is VAID-neutral: it specifies nothing about any particular commercial
deployment of VAID, and a party with no relationship to Synthera can implement it
from this document alone.

## 8. Non-goals

- This extension does not define how a client obtains a VAID in the first place
  (minting is `vaid_mint.mint.MintService`, out of scope for A2A).
- This extension does not define revocation transport (`docs/spec/revocation.md`
  R.1 already excludes that from the VAID conformance surface; the same exclusion
  applies here).
- This extension does not require `actorChain` (#2028) or any other extension to
  be active. §4.1 describes an optional composition, not a dependency.
