# vaid-a2a

Reference verifier for the VAID [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org) extension
specified in [`docs/a2a/v1/extension.md`](../../docs/a2a/v1/extension.md)
(**draft**).

A2A lets agents delegate work to agents. [a2aproject/A2A#2028](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/issues/2028)
proposes `actorChain`, a caller-supplied record of who acted for whom, and is
explicit that a self-reported chain can narrow perfectly while proving no
actual authority. This extension supplies one concrete, offline-checkable
proof a hop can point at to fill that gap: a VAID — a signed, attenuated,
revocable delegation document this repo already mints and verifies in three
languages.

This package does not implement the extension's wire format; it implements
the **verification side**: given an A2A `Message` (as a plain `dict`) and a
trust configuration, it extracts any VAID(s) carried under the extension's
metadata keys and runs the ordered check the spec defines, returning a typed
allow/deny result with a reason — never a bare boolean, so a caller can log,
alert, or retry the right thing.

## Install

```sh
pip install -e python/vaid-pop -e python/vaid-mint -e python/vaid-a2a
```

(No published release yet — this is a draft extension on a feature branch.
See `docs/a2a/drafts/a2a-2028-reply.md` and the branch's `REPORT-306.md`.)

## Use

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from vaid_mint.revocation import InMemoryRevocationList
from vaid_a2a import verify_a2a_message, METADATA_VAID_KEY

trust_config = {
    "trustedIssuers": [
        {"trustDomain": "vaid.example", "kernelPublicKey": "<base64url, raw 32 bytes>"}
    ]
}

message = {
    "metadata": {
        METADATA_VAID_KEY: leaf_vaid_document,       # a dict, as produced by vaid_mint
        # METADATA_CHAIN_KEY: [ancestor_vaid_1, ...],  # optional, for chain checks
    }
}

result = verify_a2a_message(
    message,
    trust_config=trust_config,
    revocation=InMemoryRevocationList(),  # or your own RevocationCheck
    requested_action="data.acme.orders",
    now=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
)

if result.allowed:
    ...  # proceed
else:
    ...  # result.code (a VerifyCode) and result.reason explain why
```

See `examples/guard.py` for use as a guard in front of a request handler.

## What this checks, and in what order

Exactly the order `docs/a2a/v1/extension.md` §5 specifies — signature, leaf
expiry, chain integrity, per-hop attenuation, requested-action scope,
revocation — fail closed at the first failing step. See the module docstring
in `vaid_a2a/verifier.py` for the full reasoning behind the order; it mirrors
`vaid_mint.verify` and `vaid_mint.chain`, which this package delegates to
rather than reimplements.

| step | delegates to |
|---|---|
| 1. signature / authenticity | `vaid_mint.verify.verify_vaid_authenticity_graded` |
| 2. leaf expiry | `vaid_mint.document.is_expired_at` |
| 3. chain integrity | `vaid_mint.chain.verify_chain_at` |
| 4. per-hop attenuation | `vaid_mint.chain.verify_chain_at` (same call) |
| 5. requested action in leaf scope | `vaid_mint.document.is_in_scope` |
| 6. revocation over the full lineage | the caller's own `vaid_mint.revocation.RevocationCheck` |

## Test vectors

`tests/test_vectors.py` runs every vector in `docs/a2a/v1/vectors/*.json` and
asserts the expected result. Regenerate the vectors from `vaid-mint` tooling
with `docs/a2a/v1/vectors/generate_vectors.py`; see that directory's own README.

## Non-goals

- Does not depend on `a2a-python` or any A2A SDK — `Message` is accepted as a
  plain `dict`, so this works against any A2A server or client.
- Does not mint VAIDs (`vaid_mint.mint.MintService`) or implement revocation
  transport (`docs/spec/revocation.md` R.1) — both out of scope here, as they
  are for the extension itself.
- Does not implement `actorChain` (#2028) or require it to be present; see
  the spec's §4.1 for how the two compose when both are active.
