"""vaid-adk — VAID verification for Google ADK agent delegation and tool calls.

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) has no built-in mechanism to verify an
agent's identity before it runs, before it is delegated to as a sub-agent, or
before it calls a tool (google/adk-python#4992, #6551). This package closes
that gap for an agent already carrying a VAID (https://github.com/solara-
associates/vaid): a ``BasePlugin`` that verifies the presented VAID's
signature, expiry, delegation-chain attenuation and revocation status, and
maps its ``scope_boundary``/``capability_set`` onto the specific tool being
called, denying fail-closed whenever any of that cannot be positively
checked.

It mints nothing — minting an attenuated child VAID for a sub-agent is the
caller's job via ``vaid_mint.mint.MintService.mint_child``, exactly as the
existing forge-agents/synthera ADK adapters already do. This package only
verifies and authorizes what has already been minted, using the same
``vaid_mint`` primitives ``vaid-langchain`` and the VAID A2A extension build
on.

Usage::

    from vaid_adk import ToolAuthorization, VaidAuthPlugin, VaidPresentation
    from vaid_mint.chain import KernelKeyMap
    from vaid_mint.revocation import InMemoryRevocationList

    plugin = VaidAuthPlugin(
        keys=KernelKeyMap([issuer_kernel_public_key]),
        revocation=my_revocation_check,  # see the README's production note
        tool_authorizations={"lookup_order": ToolAuthorization(capability="read")},
    )
    plugin.register("sub_agent", VaidPresentation(leaf=child_vaid, chain=(parent_vaid,)))
    # runner = Runner(..., plugins=[plugin])
