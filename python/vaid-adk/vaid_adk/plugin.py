"""The ADK extension point: a ``BasePlugin`` that verifies a VAID before an
agent runs (including as a delegated sub-agent) and before any tool call,
denying fail-closed on anything it cannot positively verify.

**Why a plugin, not a per-agent callback.** ADK's ``BaseAgent``/``LlmAgent``
accept ``before_agent_callback`` and ``before_tool_callback`` directly, and
the June 2026 ADK adapter in ``forge-agents`` wired its governed-delegation
gate that way (``before_agent_callback`` closing over one sub-agent's mint
call). That shape is reused here for *where* enforcement attaches — before an
agent runs, before a tool is called — but this package registers through
``BasePlugin`` instead of per-agent fields, for one reason: a per-agent
callback is opt-in per agent, so an agent constructed without one runs
ungoverned by omission. A ``BasePlugin`` is registered once on the app/runner
and ``invocation_context.plugin_manager`` consults it for *every* agent and
*every* tool call in the invocation tree — including a sub-agent added after
this gate was wired, and including ADK's own native delegation
(``transfer_to_agent`` / ``sub_agents``) with no further code at the call
site. There is no agent that can be forgotten.

**What is NOT in scope here.** This package verifies and authorizes; it does
not mint. Minting an attenuated child VAID for a sub-agent is the caller's
job, using ``vaid_mint.mint.MintService.mint_child`` directly (as the
forge-agents/synthera ADK adapters already do) — this plugin only checks
whatever VAID presentation has been registered for an agent, the same way a
server checks a bearer token it did not issue.
